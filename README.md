This is my take on the ENDER NG project on Printables but using a CR10 as the base model, this build will be Y= 512, X=483, Z=671 w/skirts&feet.  It will have a 310x310x440 build volume there is 19mm of y you could get rid of i wanted area off bed that i could use for klicky and purge/wipe. this projeect will requite cutting and tapping of extrusions

CR10 - extrusions
2020
    416 – 1
    400 – 3
2040
    460 – 2
    550 – 2
    500 – 1
the build requires the following extrusions lengths
2020
    416 - 1
    400 - 1
    443 - 2
2040
    550 - 2
    400 - 2
    480 - 2
